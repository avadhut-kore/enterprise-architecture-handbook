# Data Streaming: Stateful Stream Processing Architecture (Flink, Kafka Streams)

## 1. Architectural Purpose & Problem Context
Managing local embedded state (RocksDB), distributed checkpoints, savepoints, changelog topics, and exactly-once state recovery.

## 2. Stream Processing Architecture & Windowing Topology

## 3. Production Invariants
- Always use Event Time with realistic watermarking for financial, billing, and analytical computations.
- Ensure stateful stream processing checkpoints are saved to highly durable cloud object storage (S3/GCS).
- Design stream consumers to be idempotent; network rebalances will cause redeliveries of uncommitted batches.
