# Data Streaming: Handling Late-Arriving & Out-of-Order Events

## 1. Architectural Purpose & Problem Context
Watermark generation algorithms (bounded out-of-orderness), allowed lateness windows, and routing late stragglers to side outputs.

## 2. Stream Processing Architecture & Windowing Topology

## 3. Production Invariants
- Always use Event Time with realistic watermarking for financial, billing, and analytical computations.
- Ensure stateful stream processing checkpoints are saved to highly durable cloud object storage (S3/GCS).
- Design stream consumers to be idempotent; network rebalances will cause redeliveries of uncommitted batches.
