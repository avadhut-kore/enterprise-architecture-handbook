# Reference Architecture: Enterprise API Management Platform Architecture

## 1. Architectural Vision & Context
API gateway enforcement plane, developer self-service portal, API key subscription approvals, rate limit quotas, and monetization analytics.

## 3. Core Architectural Invariants & Governance
- External traffic must terminate at governed edge gateways with rate limiting and authentication.
- Distributed trace contexts must propagate across both synchronous RPC calls and asynchronous event headers.
- Service integrations must be protected by explicit circuit breakers and timeouts.
