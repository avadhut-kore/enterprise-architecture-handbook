# Reference Architecture: Real-Time Event Processing Platform Reference Architecture

## 1. Architectural Vision & Context
Sub-second event detection platform: Kafka event streams, Flink CEP (Complex Event Processing), sliding fraud detection windows, and real-time alerts.

## 3. Core Architectural Invariants & Governance
- External traffic must terminate at governed edge gateways with rate limiting and authentication.
- Distributed trace contexts must propagate across both synchronous RPC calls and asynchronous event headers.
- Service integrations must be protected by explicit circuit breakers and timeouts.
