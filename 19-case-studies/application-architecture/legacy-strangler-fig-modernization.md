# Architectural Case Study: Insurance Carrier: Strangler Fig Core System Modernization

## 1. Executive Summary & Problem Context
Decommissioning a 25-year-old COBOL/VB policy system incrementally over 18 months using an Azure API Management reverse proxy and modern Spring Boot microservices with zero downtime.

## 3. Key Architectural Decisions & Measurable Outcomes
- **Technical Metrics**: P99 latency reduced, build/test cycle times cut by >50%, and deployment frequency increased from monthly to multiple times daily.
- **Business Impact**: Significant infrastructure cost reductions, improved time-to-market for new features, and elimination of critical outages.
- **Lessons Learned**: Avoid big-bang rewrites; establish automated fitness functions early; and decouple data storage boundaries before attempting code separation.
