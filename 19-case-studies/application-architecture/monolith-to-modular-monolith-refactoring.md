# Architectural Case Study: Supply Chain Enterprise: Monolith to Modular Monolith Refactoring

## 1. Executive Summary & Problem Context
Systematically untangling circular dependencies across 1.2 million lines of legacy C# code into 8 cleanly isolated domain modules enforced via ArchUnitNET.

## 3. Key Architectural Decisions & Measurable Outcomes
- **Technical Metrics**: P99 latency reduced, build/test cycle times cut by >50%, and deployment frequency increased from monthly to multiple times daily.
- **Business Impact**: Significant infrastructure cost reductions, improved time-to-market for new features, and elimination of critical outages.
- **Lessons Learned**: Avoid big-bang rewrites; establish automated fitness functions early; and decouple data storage boundaries before attempting code separation.
