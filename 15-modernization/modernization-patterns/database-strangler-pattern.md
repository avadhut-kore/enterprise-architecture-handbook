# Database Strangler Pattern

## 1. Problem & Context
Monolithic database tables cannot be split in a single maintenance window.

## 2. Forces & Trade-Offs
- **Delivery Velocity vs. Stability**: How quickly the business needs the new capability vs. the risk of breaking existing behavior.
- **Data Consistency vs. Decoupling**: Maintaining ACID guarantees across systems vs. embracing eventual consistency.

## 3. Solution Architecture
Extract tables incrementally: replicate via CDC, switch reads, switch writes, drop legacy table.

```
[Inbound Request] ──► [Routing Boundary / Facade]
                              │
               ┌──────────────┴──────────────┐
               ▼                             ▼
       [Legacy Component]            [Modern Component]
               │                             │
               └──────────────┬──────────────┘
                              ▼
                   [Output Parity / State]
```

## 4. Implementation Steps
1. Establish baseline characterization tests capturing existing legacy behavior.
2. Introduce the abstraction layer or routing facade at the boundary.
3. Deploy the modern implementation in parallel.
4. Verify behavioral equivalence under production load.
5. Decommission the legacy pathway.

## 5. When NOT to Use
When database transactions require cross-table foreign key constraints that cannot be decoupled.
