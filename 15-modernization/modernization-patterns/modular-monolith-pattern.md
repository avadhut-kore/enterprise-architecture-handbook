# Modular Monolith Pattern

## 1. Problem & Context
Team needs modularity and domain separation without the operational tax of microservices.

## 2. Forces & Trade-Offs
- **Delivery Velocity vs. Stability**: How quickly the business needs the new capability vs. the risk of breaking existing behavior.
- **Data Consistency vs. Decoupling**: Maintaining ACID guarantees across systems vs. embracing eventual consistency.

## 3. Solution Architecture
Enforce strict module boundaries, package-private encapsulation, and explicit public interfaces within a single deployable artifact.

```
[Inbound Request] ──► [Routing Boundary / Facade]
                              │
               ┌──────────────┴──────────────┐
               ▼                             ▼
       [Legacy Component]            [Modern Component]
               │                             │
               └──────────────┬──────────────┘
                              ▼
                   [Output Parity / State]
```

## 4. Implementation Steps
1. Establish baseline characterization tests capturing existing legacy behavior.
2. Introduce the abstraction layer or routing facade at the boundary.
3. Deploy the modern implementation in parallel.
4. Verify behavioral equivalence under production load.
5. Decommission the legacy pathway.

## 5. When NOT to Use
When different modules require vastly divergent physical compute or deployment cadences.
