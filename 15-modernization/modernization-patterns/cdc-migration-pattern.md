# Change Data Capture (CDC) Migration Pattern

## 1. Problem & Context
Zero-downtime database migration requires continuous synchronization of in-flight mutations.

## 2. Forces & Trade-Offs
- **Delivery Velocity vs. Stability**: How quickly the business needs the new capability vs. the risk of breaking existing behavior.
- **Data Consistency vs. Decoupling**: Maintaining ACID guarantees across systems vs. embracing eventual consistency.

## 3. Solution Architecture
Stream binary transaction logs (WAL/Redo) from source DB to target DB without application performance impact.

[Inbound Request] ──► [Routing Boundary / Facade]
                              │
               ┌──────────────┴──────────────┐
               ▼                             ▼
       [Legacy Component]            [Modern Component]
               │                             │
               └──────────────┬──────────────┘
                              ▼
                   [Output Parity / State]
```

## 4. Implementation Steps
1. Establish baseline characterization tests capturing existing legacy behavior.
2. Introduce the abstraction layer or routing facade at the boundary.
3. Deploy the modern implementation in parallel.
4. Verify behavioral equivalence under production load.
5. Decommission the legacy pathway.

## 5. When NOT to Use
When target database has an entirely incompatible paradigm (e.g. relational to graph).
