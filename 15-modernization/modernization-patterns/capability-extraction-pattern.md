# Capability Extraction Pattern

## 1. Problem & Context
A specific vertical business feature must be unbundled from a legacy monolith.

## 2. Forces & Trade-Offs
- **Delivery Velocity vs. Stability**: How quickly the business needs the new capability vs. the risk of breaking existing behavior.
- **Data Consistency vs. Decoupling**: Maintaining ACID guarantees across systems vs. embracing eventual consistency.

## 3. Solution Architecture
Extract UI, business logic, and database tables for a single cohesive vertical capability into an independent service.

[Inbound Request] ──► [Routing Boundary / Facade]
                              │
               ┌──────────────┴──────────────┐
               ▼                             ▼
       [Legacy Component]            [Modern Component]
               │                             │
               └──────────────┬──────────────┘
                              ▼
                   [Output Parity / State]
```

## 4. Implementation Steps
1. Establish baseline characterization tests capturing existing legacy behavior.
2. Introduce the abstraction layer or routing facade at the boundary.
3. Deploy the modern implementation in parallel.
4. Verify behavioral equivalence under production load.
5. Decommission the legacy pathway.

## 5. When NOT to Use
When the capability has circular data dependencies on 10 other monolithic modules.
