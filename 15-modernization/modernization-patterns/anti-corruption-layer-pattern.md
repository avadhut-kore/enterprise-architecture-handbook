# Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL) Pattern

## 1. Problem & Context
Legacy data models and obsolete naming conventions leak into and contaminate new cloud microservices.

## 2. Forces & Trade-Offs
- **Delivery Velocity vs. Stability**: How quickly the business needs the new capability vs. the risk of breaking existing behavior.
- **Data Consistency vs. Decoupling**: Maintaining ACID guarantees across systems vs. embracing eventual consistency.

## 3. Solution Architecture
Deploy a bidirectional adapter layer that translates legacy models into clean domain entities and vice-versa.

```
[Inbound Request] ──► [Routing Boundary / Facade]
                              │
               ┌──────────────┴──────────────┐
               ▼                             ▼
       [Legacy Component]            [Modern Component]
               │                             │
               └──────────────┬──────────────┘
                              ▼
                   [Output Parity / State]
```

## 4. Implementation Steps
1. Establish baseline characterization tests capturing existing legacy behavior.
2. Introduce the abstraction layer or routing facade at the boundary.
3. Deploy the modern implementation in parallel.
4. Verify behavioral equivalence under production load.
5. Decommission the legacy pathway.

## 5. When NOT to Use
When the two systems already share a clean, agreed-upon canonical data model.
