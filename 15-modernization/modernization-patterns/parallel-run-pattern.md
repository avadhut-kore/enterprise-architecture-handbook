# Parallel Run Pattern

## 1. Problem & Context
High-risk calculations (payroll, core ledger) cannot tolerate any discrepancies between legacy and new engines.

## 2. Forces & Trade-Offs
- **Delivery Velocity vs. Stability**: How quickly the business needs the new capability vs. the risk of breaking existing behavior.
- **Data Consistency vs. Decoupling**: Maintaining ACID guarantees across systems vs. embracing eventual consistency.

## 3. Solution Architecture
Execute transactions through both systems simultaneously; compare calculated outputs; legacy remains authoritative until 30 days of 100% parity.

```

## 4. Implementation Steps
1. Establish baseline characterization tests capturing existing legacy behavior.
2. Introduce the abstraction layer or routing facade at the boundary.
3. Deploy the modern implementation in parallel.
4. Verify behavioral equivalence under production load.
5. Decommission the legacy pathway.

## 5. When NOT to Use
When transactions have irreversible external side effects (e.g., credit card charges).
