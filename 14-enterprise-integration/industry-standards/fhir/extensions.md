# FHIR Extensions Architecture and Governance

## 1. Extension Anatomy
Every FHIR resource contains an optional `extension` array allowing custom attributes:
```json
{
  "url": "http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-race",
  "extension": [
    {
      "url": "ombCategory",
      "valueCoding": {
        "system": "urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.6.238",
        "code": "2106-3",
        "display": "White"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## 2. Production Architecture Best Practices
- **Strict Boundary Validation**: Never trust incoming payloads implicitly; enforce schema contracts and payload size limits at the ingress layer.
- **Fail-Safe Idempotency**: State-mutating operations must track idempotency keys in a low-latency distributed cache (e.g., Redis) with an appropriate time-to-live.
- **Circuit Breaking & Fallback**: Integrate circuit breakers with sensible failure rate thresholds (typically 50% over a 30s sliding window) to prevent cascading dependency failure.

## 3. Security & Operational Checklist
- [ ] Enforce mutual TLS (mTLS) with TLS 1.3 across all inter-system communications.
- [ ] Mandate distributed trace context (`traceparent`) and business correlation IDs on every hop.
- [ ] Ensure non-transient failures are isolated to a Dead Letter Queue with real-time alerting.
