## 1. Architectural Purpose & Problem Context
Classifying mismatches: Missing Internal, Missing External, Amount Mismatch, Fee Mismatch, Timing Differences, and Currency Conversions.

## 3. Production Invariants
- Never use fuzzy matching for financial transaction reconciliation; matching must be deterministic and rule-governed.
- All reconciliation exceptions must be tracked in an auditable exception queue with SLA-driven resolution targets.
- Adjustments and ledger write-offs must enforce strict four-eyes authorization controls.
