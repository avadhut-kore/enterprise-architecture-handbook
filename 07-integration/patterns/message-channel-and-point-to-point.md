# Integration Pattern: Message Channel & Point-to-Point Channel Patterns

## 1. Pattern Purpose & Context
Connecting applications via dedicated virtual channels; ensuring exactly one receiver consumes each message in point-to-point queues.

## 3. Production Invariants & Evaluation
- Prefer simple standard messaging constructs before introducing complex multi-step routing graphs.
- Protect enricher components with local caching to prevent saturating external reference databases.
- Ensure all split messages retain an immutable correlation ID to enable deterministic downstream aggregation.
