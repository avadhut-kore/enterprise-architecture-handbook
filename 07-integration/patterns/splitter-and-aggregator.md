# Integration Pattern: Splitter & Aggregator Patterns

## 1. Pattern Purpose & Context
Decomposing batch messages into discrete elements for parallel processing, and correlating/reassembling results using correlation IDs.

## 3. Production Invariants & Evaluation
- Prefer simple standard messaging constructs before introducing complex multi-step routing graphs.
- Protect enricher components with local caching to prevent saturating external reference databases.
- Ensure all split messages retain an immutable correlation ID to enable deterministic downstream aggregation.
